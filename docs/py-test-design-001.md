# Python sys.monitoring Tracer Test Design

## Overview
This document outlines a test suite for validating the Python tracer built on `sys.monitoring` and `runtime_tracing`. Each test item corresponds to roughly 1–10 lines of implementation and exercises tracer behavior under typical and edge conditions.

## Setup
- Establish a temporary directory for trace output and source snapshots.
- Install the tracer module and import helper utilities for running traced Python snippets.
- Provide fixtures that clear the trace buffer and reset global state between tests.

## Tool Initialization
- Acquire a monitoring tool ID and ensure subsequent calls reuse the same identifier.
- Register callbacks for all enabled events and verify the resulting mask matches the design.
- Unregister callbacks on shutdown and confirm no events fire afterward.

## Event Recording
### Control Flow Events
- Capture `PY_START` and `PY_RETURN` for a simple script and assert a start/stop pair is recorded.
- Resume and yield events within a generator function produce matching `PY_RESUME`/`PY_YIELD` entries.
- A `PY_THROW` followed by `RERAISE` generates the expected unwind and rethrow sequence.

### Call Tracking
- Direct function calls record `CALL` and `PY_RETURN` with correct frame identifiers.
- Recursive calls nest frames correctly and unwind in LIFO order.
- Decorated functions ensure wrapper frames are recorded separately from wrapped frames.

### Line and Branch Coverage
- A loop with conditional branches emits `LINE` events for each executed line and `BRANCH` for each branch taken or skipped.
- Jump statements such as `continue` and `break` produce `JUMP` events with source and destination line numbers.

### Exception Handling
- Raising and catching an exception emits `RAISE` and `EXCEPTION_HANDLED` events with matching exception IDs.
- An uncaught exception records `RAISE` followed by `PY_UNWIND` and terminates the trace with a `PY_THROW`.

### C API Boundary
- Calling a built-in like `len` results in `C_CALL` and `C_RETURN` events linked to the Python frame.
- A built-in that raises, such as `int("a")`, generates `C_RAISE` with the translated exception value.

## Value Translation
- Primitive values (ints, floats, strings, bytes) round-trip through the value registry and appear in the trace as expected.
- Complex collections like lists of dicts are serialized recursively with cycle detection preventing infinite loops.
- Object references without safe representations fall back to `repr` with a stable identifier.

## Metadata and Source Capture
- The trace writer copies the executing script into the output directory and records its SHA-256 hash.
- Traces include `ProcessMetadata` fields for Python version and platform.

## Shutdown Behavior
- Normal interpreter exit flushes the trace and closes files without losing events.
- An abrupt shutdown via `os._exit` truncates the trace file but leaves previous events intact.

## Error and Edge Cases
- Invalid event names in manual callback registration raise a clear `ValueError`.
- Attempting to trace after the writer is closed results in a no-op without raising.
- Large string values exceeding the configured limit are truncated with an explicit marker.

## Performance and Stress
- Tracing a tight loop of 10⁶ iterations completes within an acceptable time budget.
- Concurrent threads each produce isolated traces with no frame ID collisions.
